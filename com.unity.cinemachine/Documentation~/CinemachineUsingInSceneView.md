# Authoring in Scene View

Since Unity 2023.2, the [Cameras Overlay](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/cameras-overlay.html) offers the ability to all users to look through their cameras, directly within the Scene View.

It brings a new workflow with Cameras in the Scene View:

* See what a Cinemachine Camera sees (framing) in the Scene View, without the need to enable the Solo mode.
* Author a Cinemachine Camera [in first person](https://docs.unity3d.com/2023.2/Documentation/Manual/control-camera.html) with the Scene View's navigation tool.
